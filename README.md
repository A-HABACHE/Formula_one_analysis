 I've created a Microsoft Power BI dashboard using the Formula 1 dataset. This dashboard is centered around analyzing the performance of top Formula 1 teams # and racers during the years 1950 to 2023. It highlights key performance indicators (KPIs) that provide insights into:

 - Team achievements
 - The most accomplished racers
 - The top racers within the leading teams
 - How teams and racers performed on specific race circuits.
